**Effort Adjustment Factor (EAF)** = 1.06

## 4. Effort Calculation
**Formula**:
E (Effort) = a × (Size)^b × EAF

E = 2.4 × (5.5)^1.05 × 1.06 = 2.4 × 5.97 × 1.06 = 15.18 Person-Months

## 5. Development Time Calculation
**Formula**:
D (Duration) = c × (E)^d

D = 2.5 × (15.18)^0.38 = 2.5 × 2.49 = 6.23 Months

## 6. Average Staffing Level
**Average Staff** = Effort / Duration = 15.18 / 6.23 = 2.44 ≈ 2–3 people

## 7. Detailed Phase-Wise Distribution
| Phase                  | Effort % | Effort (PM) | Duration (Months) |

3. **Cross-training team members**: Enable flexibility in task allocation
4. **Regular code reviews**: Maintain quality despite accelerated pace
5. **Parallel development**: Use feature branches for concurrent work
